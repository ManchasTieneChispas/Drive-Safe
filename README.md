# Drive-Safe
An Android application developed intended to track a users facial features as they drive, and alert them if they are drowsy. It features automatic drowsiness detection, as well as crash detection with an automatic dial to 911. 

## Use
To use simply setup the phone on your dashboard with a phone dashboard mount, with the front camera facing towards you, with your face in sight. Then just open up the app and click Start. 

### How?
The app uses PERCLOS (Percentage of Eyelid Closure) to determine if the driver is becoming drowsy. PERCLOS is proven to be effective for this. 
The automatic crash detection uses the phones onboard accelerometer to determine if there has been an acceleration consistent with an accident.
